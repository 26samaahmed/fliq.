Fliq. is a collaborative, browser-based photo booth application designed to provide a unique
and interactive way for friends to create and share memories, no matter where they are. This platform
functions as a digital photo booth, giving users the ability to capture live photos from their device's
camera or upload existing images. The key innovation is its real-time collaboration feature, which
enables multiple users to simultaneously work on a single photo strip, adding custom captions,
backgrounds, and stickers. This moves the traditional photo booth experience online, allowing for
shared creative moments that transcend physical distance. Finalized creations can be organized and
saved into personalized, shareable albums, creating a lasting collection of collaborative memories.
